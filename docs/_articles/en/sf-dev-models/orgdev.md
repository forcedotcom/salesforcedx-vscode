## Org Development Model

Use the Org Development model work with orgs that donâ€™t have source tracking, such as sandboxes, Developer Edition (DE) orgs, or Trailhead Playgrounds, in Visual Studio Code. With this development model, you must track changes manually and deploy sets of changes to sandboxes and then to your production org. See the [Org Development Model](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/org-development-model) Trailhead module.
