Edit your user, workspace and extension pack settings.

## User and Workspace Settings

To edit your workspace settings, select **File** > **Preferences** > **Settings** (Windows or Linux) or **Code** > **Settings...** > **Settings** (macOS). For information about configuring your settings, see [User and Workspace Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings) in the Visual Studio Code documentation for more information.

## Extension Pack Settings

The Salesforce extensions pack contributes to its own settings, which you can review under the Extensions section of the Settings editor. To list all the settings for this extension pack, search the settings for `salesforcedx-vscode`. We use some extension settings to provide access to beta features and other customizations.
