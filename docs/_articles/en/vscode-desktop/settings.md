## Workspace Settings
To edit your workspace settings, select **File** > **Preferences** > **Settings** (Windows or Linux) or **Code** > **Preferences** > **Settings** (macOS). For information about configuring your settings, see [User and Workspace Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings) in the Visual Studio Code docs.

## Extension Settings
We use extension settings to provide access to beta features and other customizations.

## Stop CLI Success Messages
To stop Salesforce CLI success messages from showing as pop-up information messages, click **Show Only in Status Bar** in a success message. This button overrides the `salesforcedx-vscode-core.show-cli-success-msg` value in your default settings. It changes the Workspace Settings value to `false`. Setting this value to `false` makes the success messages appear in the status bar (in VS Codeâ€™s footer) instead of as information messages. If you decide that you liked the information messages after all, change the value back to `true`.

To see the other settings for this extension pack, search the settings for `salesforcedx-vscode`.
