## Overview

Before you get started, install the required software on your computer.

## Visual Studio Code

Install Visual Studio Code on any computer running macOS, Windows, or Linux. VS Code’s [system requirements](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/requirements) are fairly small, so it should run well on most computers.

To install Visual Studio Code visit <https://code.visualstudio.com> and click the big green **Download** button. After the download finishes, open the installer and follow the steps to complete the installation.

## Salesforce Extensions for Visual Studio Code

Want to develop locally? Already using VS Code? Install Salesforce Extensions and Salesforce CLI to develop quickly and more productively on Salesforce platform.

## Salesforce CLI

Salesforce CLI is used to execute commands against Salesforce orgs and work with source files on your local machine. Salesforce Extensions for VS Code uses Salesforce CLI behind the scenes, so even if you don’t want to use the CLI directly you need to install it on your machine.

For information about installing Salesforce CLI, see the _[Salesforce DX Setup Guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_install_cli.htm)_.

## Java Platform, Standard Edition Development Kit

Some features in Salesforce Extensions for VS Code depend upon the Java Platform, Standard Edition Development Kit (JDK). You need to have either version 8, 11 or 17 of the JDK installed. See [Java Setup](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode/en/vscode-desktop/java-setup) for details.
