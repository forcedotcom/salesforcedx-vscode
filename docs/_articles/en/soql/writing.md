title: Write SOQL Queries

You can use the SOQL query snippet to see code completion suggestions for your SOQL queries.

To learn about how to use the Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL), see [SOQL and SOSL Reference](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.soql_sosl.meta/soql_sosl/sforce_api_calls_soql.htm).

> NOTICE: The SOQL Language Server is currently in beta. If you find any bugs or have feedback, [open a GitHub issue](./en/bugs-and-feedback). See our [Roadmap](https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode/wiki/Roadmap) for more information.

## Develop with the SOQL Language Server

To develop with the SOQL language server, create a `.soql` file. We recommend that the `soql` file is located outside the directories registered in your `sfdx-project.json` because this is not a file to deploy to your org. The purpose of the `.soql` file is to provide a way to build and test SOQL query before you import it to your Apex code.

## View Code Completion Suggestions

You must refresh the SObject definitions so that the SOQL language server can provide code completion suggestions. Run `SFDX: Refresh SObject Definitions` from the Command Palette.

- To see code completion suggestions, press Ctrl+space when youâ€™re working in a `.soql` file.
- To navigate between the suggestions, use the arrow keys.
- To auto-complete from the suggestion, press Enter.
