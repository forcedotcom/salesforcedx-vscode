In addition to the extension pack shipped by Salesforce, the following extensions are useful for Salesforce developers.  We also package the Extension pack with some of the most-used community extensions in the [expanded extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.salesforcedx-vscode-expanded). 

## Apex PMD

Allows you to run Apex static analysis directly in VS Code on Apex and Visualforce files.

## Prettier

Keeping your code consistent and nicely formatted is important in any programming language. Prettier supports formatting for many files used by Salesforce developers, such as JavaScript and CSS files.

> NOTE: Prettier also supports Apex formatting through the [Prettier Apex plugin](https://github.com/dangmai/prettier-plugin-apex).

## ESLint

Analyzes your JavaScript code to find issues and to help you fix them.  As a part of the LWC extension, Salesforce provides specific ESLint rules and you can also add your own.  These preconfigured rules help you to write high quality code.
