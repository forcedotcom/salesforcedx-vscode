title: Java Setup

The Apex Language Server, shipped as part of the Salesforce Apex Extension for VS Code depends upon the Java Platform, Standard Edition Development Kit (JDK). It requires an installation of either JDK version 11 (Recommended) or JDK version 8. By default, the extension attempts to locate your local Java installation by looking for a `JAVA_HOME` or `JDK_HOME` environment variable on your computer. If the extension cannot find your Java installation, or if you want it to use a different installation, change the `salesforcedx-vscode-apex.java.home` setting.

1. Select **File** > **Preferences** > **Settings** (Windows or Linux) or **Code** > **Preferences** > **Settings** (macOS).
1. Search for `apex`.
1. Change the `salesforcedx-vscode-apex.java.home` setting to the full pathname of your Java Runtime. Do **not** set it to the Java executable itself.

## Advanced Setup

By default, a JVM allocates up to one fourth of the system's physical memory to the Apex Language Server process. If you are working on projects with more memory requirements, use the `salesforcedx-vscode-apex.java.memory` setting to override the defaults. Use this setting to specify the maximum size of memory allocation in megabytes and in multiples of 1024.

```json
{
  "salesforcedx-vscode-apex.java.memory": "4096"
}
```
