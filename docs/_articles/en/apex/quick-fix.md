## Quick Fix: Declare Missing Methods

You can invoke the Quick Fix widget when you reference a method that isnâ€™t declared in your source. The widget declares the method for you automatically.

There are three ways to invoke the Declare Missing Methods quick fix in VS Code.

1. When you click the name of the undeclared method, a lightbulb appears on the left side of the editor window. Click the lightbulb, then click **Create method '_yourMethod_' in '_YourClass_'** to make the quick fix.
