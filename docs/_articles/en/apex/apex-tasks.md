## Use Anonymous Apex to Mass Update Account Ratings

Say you have accounts with `Rating` set to `Cold` because of unfavorable business conditions. You now want to make mass updates to these accounts and change their rating to `Warm`.  You want to limit this update to mid-sized accounts with more than a certain amount of revenue. 

This Anonymous Apex code updates ratings of accounts that have an annual revenue greater than `$10,000,000` and have more than `1000` employees:


1. In the `scripts/apex` folder, create an Anonymous Apex file using the `.apex` file extension.
Paste this code into the file:

      ```
      List<Account> acctList =[SELECT Name, Rating FROM Account
        WHERE AnnualRevenue > 500000 AND NumberOfEmployees > 100];
      for (Account acc: acctList){
          if (acc.Rating == 'Cold') {
              acc.Rating = 'Warm'; 
              update acc;
          }
              System.debug(acc.Name + acc.Rating);
      }
      ```

2. Click **Execute Anonymous Apex** to execute your code.

The `DEBUG CONSOLE` lists accounts and their updated ratings.
