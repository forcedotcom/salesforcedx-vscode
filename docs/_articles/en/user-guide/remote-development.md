## Overview

Salesforce Extension for VS Code supports remote development and allows you to use a container as a full-featured development environment. You can open a project mounted into a Docker container or use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2 to edit with full code completions, code navigation, debugging, and more.

> NOTICE: The remote development feature is currently in beta. If you find any bugs or have feedback, [open a GitHub issue](./bugs-and-feedback).

Refer to VS Code documentation if you want to understand more about remote development:

- Use a [Docker container](https://www.docker.com/) as your [development container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_indepth-setting-up-a-folder-to-run-in-a-container)
- Use [WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) as your [development container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl)
- Provide [full-featured development environment](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview)
- Switch your development environment by [connecting to a container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)

## Using a Docker Container

Follow these instruction for remote development using a Docker Container.

### Install

To start remote development in dev container, install:

- Docker Desktop. For system requirements and installation instructions, see:
  - [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/): Currently Docker desktop for windows supports only Linux Containers and [not Windows Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_known-limitations). During the install process, ensure you use the default option of Linux Containers.
  - [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
  - [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/)
- Latest version of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Latest version of [VS Code Remote Development Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack).
  After you install VS Code and Docker Desktop for your operating system:
  - For Windows, set source code locations you want to open in a container. In Docker, right-click and select **Settings** / **Preferences** > **Shared Drives** / **File Sharing**. See [Container tips](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/troubleshooting#_container-tips) if you hit trouble with sharing.
  - For Linux, see [supported platforms](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms). From the terminal, run `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER` to add your user to the `docker` group. This setting takes effect after you sign out and back in again.
- Latest version of the [Salesforce Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.salesforcedx-vscode)

### Open a Project in a Dev Container

1. Open an existing project you want to work with or create a new project.
1. From the Command Palette, run **Remote-Containers: Add Development Container Configuration Files**.
   If you are unable to see this command, make sure that you have installed the latest version of VS Code Remote Development Extension Pack.

1. Select **Salesforce Project** from the list of templates to add `SFDX .devcontainer` folder. The `.devcontainer` folder contains the `devcontainer.json` file that defines how to configure the dev container, the Dockerfile to use, and the extensions to install.

   VS Code detects the dev container configuration file and prompts you to reopen the project folder in a container. If the pop-up window disappears, from the Command Palette, run **Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container**.

   VS Code creates a dev container the first time you open the project. After the dev container is built, the project folder in your local system automatically connects and maps to the container, and the side bar shows `Dev Container: Salesforce Project`. The container pre-installs and configures Java, Git, Salesforce CLI, and all other extensions defined in the `devcontainer.json` file.

1. From the Command Palette, run the **SFDX: Authorize a Dev Hub** in the container. From the Output panel (below the editor region), you can get the user code and the verification URL required to complete the authorization.

   If you are logged in to an org that you don’t want to authorize as a Dev Hub, make sure to log out. Otherwise, you're not prompted to enter the credentials for the org that you want to authorize. After the authorization is complete, the message `SFDX: Authorize a Dev Hub successfully ran` is displayed. In case the success message is not displayed, check if you have the correct user code and try again. If the login page doesn’t prompt you to re-enter the code, terminate the command and run it again.

1. Run **SFDX: Create a Default Scratch Org**.
1. Click **Reopen in Container** to build a dev container. Now the side bar shows `Dev Container: Salesforce Project`.

   You’ve set up a dev container for an existing project to use as your full-time development environment.

## Using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2

Follow these instruction for remote development using WSL 2.

### Install

First, set up WSL 2 on your machine. Follow the [instructions provided by Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). 

**Important:** Only use WSL 2. There are known issues with WSL 1. These instructions below assume Ubuntu. Other Linux distros should work, but the steps may be slightly different.

After you have installed WSL 2, set up your environment for Salesforce development. You'll need Node.js, Salesforce CLI, and  OpenJDK.

To install Node.js, follow [these instructions provided by Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/nodejs/setup-on-wsl2). We recommend that you use NVM to easily switch between node versions. For Salesforce development, you'll like use the LTS version of Node.js.

Once Node.js is set up, install Salesforce CLI by running:

```
$ npm install sfdx-cli -g
```

To install the JDK, run:

```
$ sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre-headless
```

To determine the path of your JDK installation, run:

```
$ update-java-alternatives --list
```

The output contains a path that looks something like `/usr/lib/java-1.11.0-openjdk-amd64`. Copy that path for later use.

### Open a Project in a Dev Container

1. Open an existing project or create a new project.
1. From the Command Palette, run **Remote-Containers: Add Development Container Configuration Files**.
   If you are unable to see this command, make sure that you have installed the latest version of the VS Code Remote Development Extension Pack.

   ![Add Dev Container Config Files](./images/add_dev_container.png)

1. Select **Salesforce Project** from the list of templates to add `SFDX .devcontainer` folder. The `.devcontainer` folder contains the `devcontainer.json` file that defines how to configure the dev container and the extensions to install.

   VS Code detects the dev container configuration file and prompts you to reopen the project folder in a container. **DO NOT RUN THIS YET.**

1. Open the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file and make these edits:

   - Remove the line `"dockerFile": "Dockerfile",`
   - Set the value of `salesforcedx-vscode-apex.java.home` to the path you copied earlier after the command `update-java-alternatives --list`.

1. From the Command Palette, run **Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container**.

1. Once the project is open, install the node modules. Open a new terminal in VS Code, which is mounted to the remote WSL environment, and run `npm i`.

1. Authorize orgs and create scratch orgs.
