The changes we have made to enhance performance ensure that single file metadata deploys run through a more efficient code path. Currently, these changes only support a limited number of metadata types. Weâ€™ll add support for more metadata types in future releases.

> NOTICE: The changes to enhance code performance are currently in beta. If you find any bugs or have feedback, [open a GitHub issue](./en/bugs-and-feedback).

1. Select **File** > **Preferences** > **Settings** (Windows or Linux) or **Code** > **Preferences** > **Settings** (macOS).
