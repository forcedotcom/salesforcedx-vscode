Generative AI uses large language models (LLMs) to generate the output. Because LLMs are trained by other organizations, the output isn’t always what you expect, and the code that’s generated isn’t perfect. If the output doesn’t meet your expectations, you can generate a new output by starting over. The generated output from the previous attempt isn’t saved, and the new output replaces it.
