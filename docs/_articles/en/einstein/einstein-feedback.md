## Support

If you need support, file an [issue](https://github.com/forcedotcom/Einstein-GPT-for-Developers/issues) in the GitHub repo. Our team triages all incoming issues and gets back to you as fast as we can.

**Note:** You need a github account to create an issue. If you don’t have a GitHub account, it’s easy (and free) to [sign up for one](https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home).

If you want to provide general feedback, request product enhancements, start discussions with other Einstein for Developers users or the product team, and share best practices, use the [Einstein for Developers Trailblazer Group](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/groups/0F94V000000oRJs?tab=discussion&sort=LAST_MODIFIED_DATE_DESC).
