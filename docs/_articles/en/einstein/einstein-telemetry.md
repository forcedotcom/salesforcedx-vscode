Einstein for Developers is currently in beta. Salesforce doesnâ€™t collect or use your data or code to improve the Einstein for Developers product, or train a global AI model. See our Terms of Use for more information.

Due to the nature of machine learning, Einstein for Developer can generate output that resembles code used to train the model. Neither you nor Salesforce own output generated for parties other than themselves.
