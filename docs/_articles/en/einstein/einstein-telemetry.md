Einstein for Developers is currently in beta. During beta, your feedback, prompt, and response data will be used for model training. It is assumed that you are granting Salesforce a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use Submitted Code. See our Terms of Use for more information. 

Due to the nature of machine learning, Einstein for Developer can generate output that resembles code used to train the model. Neither you nor Salesforce own output generated for parties other than themselves.
