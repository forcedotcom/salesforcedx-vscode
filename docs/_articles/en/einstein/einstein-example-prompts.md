## Overview

A prompt is natural language text that you craft to communicate with an AI. The response that’s generated depends on the quality of the prompt. Use prompt engineering to define the prompt and then refine it until you get a response that works for you. For E4D responses, prompt quality determines the quality of the Apex code that’s generated.

## About Generated Code Quality

As with all LLM-based products, the technology behind Einstein for Developers is still new. The generated output often requires editing to be customized for your individual project. Some responses aren't optimal. We'd love to hear feedback from you on the generated output through the History & Feedback Panel in the IDE. Your feedback is critical to the continuous training of our large language model (LLM) during the beta program.

We strongly encourage you to let us know when you see examples of less optimal code, so that we can continue to improve generated responses. We recommend tools such as [Apex PMD](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chuckjonas.apex-pmd) (already in your Salesforce Extension Pack) and [Salesforce Code Analyzer](https://forcedotcom.github.io/sfdx-scanner/) to ensure the quality of your generated code.

## Project Context and Grounding

In addition to your instructions, the response generated by an AI depends on the context that your instruction is grounded with. The CodeGen2.5 model has been trained on Apex data and grounded with the context of Apex programming best practices.

To extract accurate and relevant information from the model, first run **SFDX:Refresh SObjects Definitions** to gather org metadata in the form of object definitions into your project before running your query. Then use the following tips to help ground your prompts further with org context awareness to generate a high-quality response.

Currently the CodeGen2.5 model can pick up on the following context from your project and prompt:

- Apex code that’s present in your project in Apex class files (`.cls`).
- Custom objects in the schema that are mentioned in the `object__c` format. Schema information takes precedence over Apex code in the current file.
- Custom metadata when it is a part of a prompt and uses the `__mdt` suffix. The metadata added to a prompt in this way is automatically included into the context to ground generations.

## Prompt Writing Tips

We’re listing some tips for prompt writing and also providing you with some examples that help you craft your prompts. An effective prompt consists of these four parts:

1. **The Action**: The task you want the AI to accomplish.

For example:
_Create an Apex batch class named "OpenPositionMatcher"_.

2. **Context Details**: Information about the context you want the AI to use. This includes important context such as org metadata and awareness about the presence of custom objects and fields in your org. Run **SFDX:Refresh SObjects Definitions** to retrieve org metadata into your project. You can then add custom fields to your existing query.

For example:
_Create an Apex batch class named "OpenPositionMatcher" that processes "Position\_\_c" records created within the past 15 days. The class should match these open positions with suitable candidates based on their skills._

3. **Best Practices**: Details about best practices you want the AI to follow. For example, security and formatting best practices and so on.

For example:
_Create an Apex batch class named "OpenPositionMatcher" that processes custom objects "Position\_\_c" records created within the past 15 days. The class aims to match these open positions with suitable candidates based on their skills. Order the results by candidate names in descending order. Make sure the generated code follows security best practices. Separate operators with a new line._

4. **Additional Context**: Any additional information that you want to provide.

For example:
_Create an Apex batch class named "OpenPositionMatcher" that processes custom objects "Position\_\_c" records created within the past 15 days. The class should match these open positions with suitable candidates based on their skills." Order the results by candidate names in descending order. Make sure the generated code follows security best practices. Separate operators with a new line. The class is used in an LWC component._

The final prompt gives you a response that looks something like this:

```
public with sharing class OpenPositionMatcher {

    @AuraEnabled(cacheable=true)
    public static List<Candidate__c> matchSkills(String positionId) {
        try {
            Position__c position = [SELECT Id, Skills__c FROM Position__c WHERE Id = :positionId WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED];
            List<String> skills = position.Skills__c?.split(';');

            if (skills != null && !skills.isEmpty()) {
                List<Candidate__c> candidates = [
                    SELECT Id, Name, Skills__c
                    FROM Candidate__c
                    WHERE Skills__c IN :skills
                    WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED
                    ORDER BY Name DESC
                ];

                return candidates;
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.debug(e.getMessage());
            throw new AuraHandledException(e.getMessage());
        }

        return new List<Candidate__c>();
    }
}

```

## Example Prompts and Responses

**Prompt:** Write an Apex method that accepts a list of sobjects and a field name and returns a set of non null field values.

**Response:**

```
public Set<String> getFieldValues(List<sObject> records, String fieldName) {
        Set<String> fieldValues = new Set<String>();

        for (sObject record : records) {
            try {
                Object fieldValue = record.get(fieldName);
                if (fieldValue != null) {
                    fieldValues.add((String) fieldValue);
                }
            } catch (Exception e) {
                system.debug('Error: ' + e.getMessage());
            }
        }
        return fieldValues;
    }


```

**Prompt:** Create an @invocable method that serializes an input list of sObjects and returns JSON.

**Response:**

```
@InvocableMethod(label='Create Account' description='Creates a new account with the specified name, number and symbol.' category='Account')
    public static List<String> createAccounts(List<Account> accounts) {
        List<String> response = new List<String>();

        for (Account account : accounts) {
            String jsonAccount = JSON.serialize(account);
            response.add(jsonAccount);
        }

        return response;
    }

```

**Prompt:** Write an Apex method that accepts product name as input and retrieves orderitems filtered on product name.

**Response**:

```
public List<OrderItem> getOrderItemsByProductName(String productName) {
List<OrderItem> orderItems = [SELECT Description FROM OrderItem WHERE ProductCode = :productName LIMIT 50];
return orderItems;
}

```

**Prompt:** Write an Apex trigger to add the number of contacts associated with an account. In the SOQL query ensure it is secure by adding WITH USER_MODE.

```
trigger AccountTrigger on Account (after update) {
    List<Account> accountsWithContacts = [
        SELECT Id, (SELECT Id FROM Contacts)
        FROM Account
        WHERE Id IN :Trigger.newMap.keySet()
        WITH USER_MODE
    ];

    for (Account account : accountsWithContacts) {
        Integer numberOfContacts = account.Contacts.size();

        // Update the Account's "Number_of_Contacts__c" field
        account.Number_of_Contacts__c = numberOfContacts;
    }

    update accountsWithContacts;
}
```

## Edit a Prompt and Regenerate Output

A well designed prompt is key to getting a good response from Einstein. We encourage you to modify your prompts until you get Apex code that helps you complete your task at hand. When you use the `Einstein: Generate Code` command from the command palette, use the **Retry** and **Accept** options. In the sidebar, edit the prompt and click **Ask**.

For example, the prompt, "Write code to provide the ability to update the FirstName for a list of users" generates this response.

```
public with sharing class AccountService {
  public Account createAccount( String accountName, String accountNumber, String tickerSymbol ) {
    Account newAcct = new Account(
      Name = accountName,
      AccountNumber = accountNumber,
      TickerSymbol = accountNumber
    );
    return newAcct;
  }
// Function to update the FirstName for a list of users
public static List<User> updateFirstName(List<User> users, String newFirstName) {
        for (User u : users) {
            if (String.isNotBlank(u.FirstName)) {
                u.FirstName = newFirstName;
            }
        }
        return users;
 }
```

This response is good, but you can edit the prompt to generate reusable code by creating a method.

Click **Retry** and edit the prompt for more specific output. Update the prompt to say, "Write code to provide the ability to update the FirstName for a list of users as a method". This is the new response.

```
public with sharing class AccountService {
  public Account createAccount( String accountName, String accountNumber, String tickerSymbol ) {
    Account newAcct = new Account(
      Name = accountName,
      AccountNumber = accountNumber,
      TickerSymbol = accountNumber
    );
    return newAcct;
  }
}

 //This is a method that allows updating the FirstName for a list of users
    public static void updateFirstName(List<User> users) {
        for (User usr : users) {
            if (usr.FirstName != null) {
                usr.FirstName = 'New First Name';
            }
        }
    }
```

If you like this output, click **Accept**. To update your prompt and regenerate new output, click **Retry**.
