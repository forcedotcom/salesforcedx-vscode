## Set Up Overview

1.  Install the extension in VS Code.
2.  Connect to an org with Einstein for Developers enabled.
3.  Use the extension to generate Apex code from natural language instructions.

### Required Editions

**Available in**: Developer, Enterprise, Partner Developer, Performance and Unlimited Editions.

**Inoperable in**: Group, Professional, and Essentials Editions

### Required User Permissions

To configure Einstein for Developers (beta): Customize Application AND Modify All Data

### Enhanced Domain Enabled

Your Einstein for Developers org must have Enhanced Domain enabled. See [Enable Enhanced Domains](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.domain_name_enhanced_enable.htm&type=5) for more information.

## Enable Einstein for Developers

When you enable Einstein for Developers in a supported Salesforce org, all users in the org have access to the feature.

1. From Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter `Einstein for Developers`, and then select **Einstein for Developers**.

**Tip:** If you don‚Äôt see Einstein for Developers as an option under Setup in your Developer Edition org, the org was probably created before Einstein for Developers was introduced, so it doesn‚Äôt have the correct permissions. Create another Developer Edition org and then retry this step.

2. Turn on Einstein for Developers.
