Generative AI uses large language models (LLMs) to generate the output. Because LLMs are trained by other organizations, the output isn’t always what you expect, and the code that’s generated isn’t perfect. If the output doesn’t meet your expectations, you can generate a new output by starting over. The generated output from the previous attempt isn’t saved, and the new output replaces it.

We encourage you to provide feedback about the output using the 👍 and 👎 buttons. You can also comment on why the output wasn’t helpful. Thumb responses and additional feedback are shared only with Salesforce and are used for pilot feedback. To keep track of all known issues and potential workarounds, use the [Issues](https://github.com/forcedotcom/Einstein-GPT-for-Developers/issues) tab in this repo.
