## Prettier

Keeping your code consistent and nicely formatted is important in any programming language. Prettier supports formatting for many files used by Salesforce developers such as Javascript and CSS.

> NOTE: Unfortunately, prettier does not support Apex (yet, maybe [somebody](https://github.com/nchursin/prettier-apex) will build it. ;)

## XML

VS Code doesn't ship with rich XML tools by default. This extension built by Red Hat provides rich language features when you are working with XML documents such as `meta.xml` or `package.xml` files in your VS Code project.
