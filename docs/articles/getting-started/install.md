title: Install the Salesforce Extensions for Visual Studio Code
---

Before you get started you need to install the required software on your machine.

## Install Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code can be installed on any computer running macOS, Windows, or Linux. The [system requirements](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/requirements) are faily small so it should run about on any machine.

To install Visual Studio Code visit <https://code.visualstudio.com> and click the big green download button. Once it is downloaded open the installer and follow the steps to complete the installation.

## Java 8 Platform, Standard Edition Development Kit

Some features in Salesforce Extensions for VS Code depend upon the Java 8 Platform, Standard Edition Development Kit (JDK).

If you donâ€™t already have the JDK installed, install the latest version of the Java 8 JDK from [Java SE Development Kit 8 Downloads](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

## Install the Salesforce CLI

The Salesforce CLI is used to execute commands against the Salesforce Org and work with source files and metadata on your local machine. You can use the CLI directly, but even if you don't the Salesforce Extensions for Visual Studio Code require the CLI to be installed on your machine.

To install the CLI visit <https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli> and click the download button. Once it is downloaded open the installer and follow the steps to complete the installation.

## Salesforce Extensions for Visual Studio Code

Next, you will need to install the Salesforce Extension Pack to Visual Studio Code. The extension pack contains everything you need to develop Salesforce apps using Visual Studio Code.

To install the extensions visit <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.salesforcedx-vscode> and click the green "Install" link. This will prompt you to open Visual Studio Code. Once Visual Studio Code is open a dialog will open in the lower right corner asking you to install the extension. Click "Install" to proceed.
