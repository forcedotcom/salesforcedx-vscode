title: Getting Started
---

This guide helps Salesforce developers who are new to Visual Studio Code go from zero to a deployed app using the Salesforce Extensions for Visual Studio Code.

## Part 1: System Setup

Before you get started you need to install the required software on your machine.

### Install Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code can be installed on any computer running macOS, Windows, or Linux. The [system requirements](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/requirements) are faily small so it should run about on any machine.

To install Visual Studio Code visit <https://code.visualstudio.com> and click the big green download button. Once it is downloaded open the installer and follow the steps to complete the installation.

### Install the Salesforce CLI

The Salesforce CLI is used to execute commands against the Salesforce Org and work with source files and metadata on your local machine. You can use the CLI directly, but even if you don't the Salesforce Extensions for Visual Studio Code require the CLI to be installed on your machine.

To install the CLI visit <https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli> and click the download button. Once it is downloaded open the installer and follow the steps to complete the installation.

### Salesforce Extensions for Visual Studio Code

Next, you will need to install the Salesforce Extension Pack to Visual Studio Code. The extension pack contains everything you need to develop Salesforce apps using Visual Studio Code.

To install the extensions visit <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.salesforcedx-vscode> and click the green "Install" link. This will prompt you to open Visual Studio Code. Once Visual Studio Code is open a dialog will open in the lower right corner asking you to install the extension. Click "Install" to proceed.

Once the extensions are installed you will see the blue button asking you to reload Visual Studio Code to finish the install. You can also just close and reopen Visual Studio Code.

## Part 2: Creating a Project

There are two types of developer processes or models supported in Visual Studio Code. These models are explained below. Each model offers pros and cons and is fully supported.

### Org Development Model

The first supported model is the model most developers are already familiar with today - called Org Development Model. This model allows you to connect directly to you Sandbox, Developer Edition, Trailhead, or even Production orgs and retrieve and deploy code directly. This is the type of development you have done in the past using tools such as the Force.com IDE or MavensMate.

In order to start developing with this model, see the guide [Develop Against Any Org in Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode/wiki/Develop-Against-Any-Org-in-Visual-Studio-Code).

If you are developing against sandboxes, developer edition, or trailhead orgs you should have used the command `SFDX: Create Project with Manifest` to create this project. If you used another command you may want to start over with that command.

When working with source against scratch orgs you will use the commands `SFDX: Deploy Source to Org` and `SFDX: Retrieve Source from Org`. The `Push` and `Pull` commands will only work on scratch orgs.

### Package Development Model

The second supported model is called Package Development Model. This model allows you to create self-contained applications or libraries that are deployed to your org as a single package. You can also use this model with the new type of org called Scratch Orgs. This model of development is geared toward a more modern type of software development process that uses org source tracking, source control, and continuous integration/deployment.

If you are starting a new project we would recommend you consider the Package Development Model.

If you are developing against scratch orgs you should have used the command `SFDX: Create Project` to create this project. If you used another command you may want to start over with that command.

When working with source against scratch orgs you will use the commands `SFDX: Push Source to Org` and `SFDX: Pull Source from Org`. Do not use the `Retrieve` and `Deploy` version of the commands on scratch orgs.

### Understanding the `sfdx-project.json` File

The `sfdx-project.json` file contains useful configuration information for your project. See [the documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_ws_config.htm) for the full details about this file.

The most important aspects of this file for getting start are the `packageDirectories` and `sfdcLoginUrl` settings.

The `sfdcLoginUrl` is used to specify which login URL to use when authorizing an org. This is explained more in the next section.

The `packageDirectories` file tells VS Code and the Salesforce CLI where metadata files are stored. You will need at least one package directory set in your file. The default setting is shown below. This means that by default your metadata will go in the `force-app` folder. If you want to change that folder to something like `src` simply change the config and make sure the folder exists.

```json
"packageDirectories" : [
    {
      "path": "force-app",
      "default": true
    }
]
```

## Part 3: Working with Source

### Authorize an Org

Now that you have your project setup you need to authorize an org to work against. Depending on if you are working with. You can authorize any type of org with the Visual Studio Code extensions.

> If you want to connect to a sandbox org, edit your sfdx-project.json file to set sfdcLoginUrl to https://test.salesforce.com before you authorize the org.

To start the authorization process, run the command `SFDX: Authorize an Org`.

![Authorize an Org](https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode/wiki/images/authorize-org-command.png)

You will be shown the Salesforce login page. Enter your credentials and click allow to authorize VS Code.

### Working With Source Using a Package.xml File

> NOTICE: This section applies only when working against Sandbox, Developer Edition, or Trailhead orgs. Not Scratch Orgs.

If you are connected to a sandbox, developer edition, or trailhead org you will probably want to retrieve metadata from your org using a `package.xml` file. If you don't already have one, create a `package.xml` file in the `manifests` folder.

You will need to add the various metadata you want to retrieve to this file. You can read more about the `package.xml` file in [the documenation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_meta.meta/api_meta/manifest_samples.htm).

With your `package.xml` file created, you can right click on the file in the file tree or inside the contents of the file and select the command `SFDX: Retrieve Source from Org`. This will download your metadata from the org and place it in the location specified in the `sfdx-project.json` file as discussed above.

Once you retrieve your metadata your project structure will look something like the following.

```text
my-app
├── README.md
├── sfdx-project.json
├── .sfdx
├── .vscode
│   ├── extensions.json
│   └── settings.json
├── force-app
|   └── main
|       └── default
|           ├── aura
|           ├── classes
|           └── objects
└── manifests
    └── package.xml
```

Similarly, ou can deploy source by clicking on the `manifest.xml` file in the file tree or on its contents and selecting the command `SFDX: Deploy Source to Org`.

### Retrieving or Deploying Individual Files or Folders

> NOTICE: This section applies only when working against Sandbox, Developer Edition, or Trailhead orgs. Not Scratch Orgs.

In addition to retrieving or deploying metadata using `package.xml` files you can also deploy or retrieve individual folders or files. You can right click on either a folder or file and click `SFDX: Retrieve Source from Org` or `SFDX: Deploy Source to Org`.

The behaviour is such that the operation will occur on any metadata below the path you click on. For example, if you right click on the `classes` folder all apex classes that **currently exist** in that folder will be retrieved or deployed. This is important to note, running a retrieve operation on a folder like `classes` will **NOT** retrieve ALL apex classes on the org, it will only retrieve updates to classes that exist in the folder already. If you want to retrieve a new apex file you will need to add that file to a `package.xml` file and retrieve it that way.

![Deploy Source to Org](https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode/wiki/images/deploy-source-to-org.png)

### Working with Source Against Scratch Orgs

Scratch orgs support a feature called source tracking. This means that VS Code will only push and pull metadata to or from and or if there are changes. You don't need to run deploy or retrieve operations on individual files or folders or even use a `package.xml` file. Just run two commands `SFDX: Pull Source from Org` and `SFDX: Push Source to Org` and any changed metadata files will be pulled or pushed.

## Part 4: Deploying to Production

You should not deploy your code to production directly from Visual Studio Code. The deploy and retrieve commands do not support transactional operations. This means that a deployment can fail in a partial state. Deployments should be done using [packaging](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_dev2gp.htm) or by [converting your source](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_reference.meta/sfdx_cli_reference/cli_reference_force_source.htm#cli_reference_convert) into metadata format and using the [metadata deploy command](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_reference.meta/sfdx_cli_reference/cli_reference_force_mdapi.htm#cli_reference_deploy).
