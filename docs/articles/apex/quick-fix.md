## Quick Fix: Declare Missing Methods

You can invoke quick fix when you reference a method that is not declared in your source.
There are 2 ways to invoke quick fix in VS Code.

1. When you click on the method name then a lightbulb will show up on the left side of the editor window. On clicking the lightbulb you will have the option to invoke the quick fix.
