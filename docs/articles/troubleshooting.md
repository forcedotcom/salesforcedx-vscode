Here’s some information on how to get past roadblocks that you might encounter while using Salesforce Extensions for VS Code.

## SFDX Commands Aren’t Available

If you don’t see any SFDX commands in the command palette, make sure that you’re working on a Salesforce DX project and that you have the latest version of Salesforce CLI.

1. Make sure that the root directory you have open in VS Code contains an `sfdx-project.json` file. If you haven’t set up a Salesforce DX project, check out [Project Setup](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_workspace_setup.htm) in the _Salesforce DX Developer Guide_.
2. [Update Salesforce CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_update_cli.htm), as described in the _Salesforce DX Setup Guide_.

## Set Your Java Version

The Apex Language Server, shipped as part of the Salesforce Apex Extension for VS Code depends upon the Java 8 Platform, Standard Edition Development Kit (JDK). By default, the extension attempts to locate your local Java installation by looking for a `JAVA_HOME` or `JDK_HOME` environment variable on your computer. If the extension cannot find your Java installation, or if you want it to use a different installation, change the `salesforcedx-vscode-apex.java.home` setting.

1. Select **File** > **Preferences** > **Settings** (Windows or Linux) or **Code** > **Preferences** > **Settings** (macOS).
1. Search for `apex`.
1. Change the `salesforcedx-vscode-apex.java.home` setting to the full pathname of your Java Runtime. Do **not** set it to the Java executable itself.

- On macOS, set it to:

```
"salesforcedx-vscode-apex.java.home":"/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_131.jdk/Contents/Home"
```

- On Windows, set it to:

```
"salesforcedx-vscode-apex.java.home":"C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_131"
```

## Monitor Apex Language Server Output

The Apex Language Server is an implementation of the [Language Server Protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol) 3.0 specification. The Language Server Protocol allows a tool (in this case, VS Code) to communicate with a language smartness provider (the server). VS Code uses the Apex Language Server to show outlines of Apex classes and triggers, code-completion suggestions, and syntactic errors. To see all diagnostic information from the Apex Language Server, select **View** > **Output**, then choose **Apex Language Server** from the dropdown menu. The diagnostic information gives you insights into the progress of the language server and shows the problems encountered.

## Activate the Apex Language Server

If the Apex features aren’t available, activate the Apex Language Server. In the VS Code menu bar, select **View** > **Output** and select **Apex Language Server** from the drop-down list on the right. If you don't see an "Apex Language Server" entry, the language server didn’t activate.

If the Apex Language Server didn’t activate, ensure that you've:

1. Opened a Salesforce DX project that has a valid `sfdx-project.json` file.
1. Opened the Salesforce DX project as a top-level folder.
1. Installed Java 1.8; you will see a warning if it's not installed.

If you’ve checked all of the above and nothing is working, check for errors in VS Code itself. In the VS Code menu bar, select **Help** > **Toggle Developer Tools**, click **Console**, and search for relevant messages.

## See Debugger Errors

To see errors generated by the debuggers, add `"trace": "all"` in your `launch.json` file. Then, re-run your scenario to view debugger log lines in VS Code’s Debug Console.
