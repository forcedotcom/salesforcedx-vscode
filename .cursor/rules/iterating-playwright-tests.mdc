## sequence

1. get a test to run for `web` locally by following "debugging" suggestions
2. desktop (locally)
3. edit github workflows if necessary
4. CI (windows, gha)

Once everything is pasing, let's clean up while keeping it that way by running the tests locally after each change.

1. removing fallbacks, waits, and "try another way"
2. very carefully aligning with `coding-playwright-tests.mdc` rules
3. consolidating locators and increasing DRY/code reuse
4. make sure everything exported from playwright-ext is used by some other ext.
5. making sure compile,lint,etc still pass (follow `test-your-changes.mdc`)

## Debugging

LLMs should not run `debug` mode playwright tests unless instructed to. Those pause and requier the human to step through.

Use @https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-inner-html on a known-good locator and use the result to get more accurate locators for stuff inside it.

Take screenshots and review them (tool call `read_file`) for additional context. If an step is unclear (why it's failing) take lots of screenshots. Always review the screenshots. They show up in `test-results` folder of the extension under test.

Capture html "parent" levels up from where you are having a problem and study it to make sure you are using correct locators.

Use emojis infrequently.
