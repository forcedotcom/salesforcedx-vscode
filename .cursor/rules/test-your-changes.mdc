when you changes a file, you should run relevant compile, linters then unit tests so that you cna propose valid changes.

If there are errors with those, you don't have a valid proposal. Iterate until you succeed, or are stuck and then propose a solution that could work.

don't change both /src and /test unless it's to refactor imports or rename. "real changes" should be one or the other.
