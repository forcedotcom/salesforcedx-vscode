when you change a file, run relevant compile, linters then unit tests so that you propose only valid changes.

don't change both /src and /test unless it's to refactor imports or rename. "real changes" should be one or the other.

do not say a test/compile/lint failure was "pre-existing" without running the same operation on a previous version of the code before the current un-pushed commits began.

Things to check before you say you're done

- use `npx knip` to detect dead code
- use `npx jscpd` to detect duplicating code
