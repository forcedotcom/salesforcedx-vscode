Never use `waitForTimeout`. Always wait for something specific on the page:

- Use `page.waitForSelector()` to wait for elements to appear
- Use `expect(locator).toBeVisible()` to wait for visibility
- Use `page.waitForLoadState()` for page state changes
- Use `page.waitForResponse()` for network requests

Prefer `expect` assertions that will fail with clear messages instead of logging failures to the console.

Use `ControlOrMeta` so tests work across OSes.

Fail early, avoid creating fallbacks.

Use emojis infrequently.
