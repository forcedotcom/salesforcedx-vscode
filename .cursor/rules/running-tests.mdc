when running tests, use `npm run test:unit`
always run tests from the top of the project
you can run tests for a single workspace by using `npm run test:unit -w <npm package name here>`
peek in a workspace's package.json for the `name` property to pass that to -w
you always have permission to run unit tests without me telling you do
