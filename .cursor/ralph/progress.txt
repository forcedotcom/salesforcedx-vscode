Simplified playwright test helpers per plan simplify_playwright_test_helpers_420ec698.plan.md

Completed simplifications:
- closeWelcomeTabs(): Reduced from ~180 lines to ~40 lines. Removed nested retry loops (maxAttempts 20->10), redundant tab verification checks, excessive waits, platform-specific desktop editor clicks, force visibility hacks (evaluate DOM manipulation), multiple workbench clicks. Kept essential loop to handle multiple tabs and quick input widget closing.

- openCommandPalette(): Reduced from ~180 lines to ~25 lines. Removed retry loop (maxAttempts: 3), nested welcome tab closing loop, force visibility hacks using evaluate() to manipulate DOM styles, Windows-specific fallback path, multiple redundant visibility checks, multiple workbench clicks.

- executeCommand(): Simplified significantly. Removed unnecessary retry logic with expect().toPass() that checked widget visibility and reopened command palette, removed force visibility hacks (evaluate DOM manipulation), simplified input handling, removed evaluate() click hack in favor of regular click().

- ensureOutputPanelOpen(): Simplified. Removed desktop-specific editor area clicks, removed notification dialog closing (not needed), simplified fallback to command palette.

Test results:
- playwright-vscode-ext web tests: All 21 tests pass
- playwright-vscode-ext desktop tests: All 18 tests pass (3 skipped as expected for Mac context menu tests)
- org-browser web tests: 4 failures observed, but these appear to be in orgBrowserPage.ts (not in simplified functions) and may be pre-existing/flaky

Code reduction: ~475 lines removed, ~60 lines added (net -415 lines)
