## Iteration - Fixed Flaky Command Palette Execution for Virtualized Lists

### Changes Made:
1. **Command Palette Execution** (`commands.ts`):
   - Fixed flaky command palette execution when command rows are hidden in virtualized lists
   - Wait for command row to be attached, check visibility, then use force parameter directly based on visibility
   - Avoids race condition where element becomes invisible between visibility check and click
   - Handles cases where VS Code's virtualized command list has elements in DOM but not visible in viewport

2. **Output Panel Opening** (`outputChannel.ts`):
   - Increased timeout for output panel to become visible after command execution (5s to 10s)
   - Better handles timing when command execution takes longer

### Test Results:
- Web: ✓ 21/21 tests pass consistently (clear output channel test passing)
- Desktop (macOS): ✓ 18 pass, 3 skipped (context menu tests + Ctrl+Shift+P test)
- Org-browser web: ✓ 4/4 tests pass
- Output channel clearing test verifies channel is completely cleared with screenshot verification

### Files Modified:
- packages/playwright-vscode-ext/src/pages/commands.ts
- packages/playwright-vscode-ext/src/pages/outputChannel.ts
- .cursor/ralph/progress.txt

### Status:
- All test files exist and are implemented (commandPalette, fileOperations, settings, outputChannel, contextMenu, helpers)
- Web tests passing consistently (21/21)
- Desktop tests passing locally on macOS (18 pass, 3 skipped as expected)
- Output channel clearing test includes screenshot verification using saveScreenshot utility (requirement 1a satisfied)
- Org-browser web tests still passing (4/4)

### Latest Changes:
- Fixed GitHub Actions workflow: removed ubuntu-latest from desktop matrix (Electron requires display server on Linux, plan only specifies Mac/Windows desktop tests)
- Fixed outputChannel test screenshot path to use saveScreenshot utility for consistency
