## Iteration - Fixed Flaky Command Palette and Settings Tests

### Changes Made:
1. **Command Palette Execution** (`commands.ts`):
   - Fixed flaky command palette input visibility by waiting for widget, then input attachment, then input visibility
   - Added wait for command list to populate after typing before searching for command row
   - Added wait for command palette to close after executing commands to prevent race conditions
   - Improved error handling and timing for better reliability across platforms

2. **Settings Textbox** (`settings.ts`):
   - Fixed flaky settings textbox test by using `clear()` instead of select-all + fill
   - More reliable on desktop platforms where keyboard shortcuts may not work consistently
   - Test now consistently sets fontSize to 16 on both web and desktop

3. **Output Channel Selection** (`outputChannel.ts`):
   - Added verification that dropdown selection took effect
   - Improved reliability for desktop platform where dropdown interaction can be slower

4. **File Operations Test** (`fileOperations.headless.spec.ts`):
   - Improved dirty indicator test to wait for tab to appear first before checking for dirty indicator
   - Prevents race condition where dirty indicator check happens before tab is fully rendered

### Test Results:
- Web: ✓ 21/21 tests pass (all tests passing consistently)
- Desktop (macOS): ✓ 18 pass, 3 skipped (2 context menu tests + 1 Ctrl+Shift+P test)
- Org-browser web: ✓ 4/4 tests pass
