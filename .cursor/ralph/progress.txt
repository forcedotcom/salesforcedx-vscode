## Iteration - Fixed Flaky Command Palette Execution for Virtualized Lists

### Changes Made:
1. **Command Palette Execution** (`commands.ts`):
   - Fixed flaky command palette execution when command rows are hidden in virtualized lists
   - Wait for command row to be attached, then click with force: true if not visible
   - This handles cases where VS Code's virtualized command list has elements in DOM but not visible in viewport
   - Improved reliability for command execution across platforms

2. **Output Panel Opening** (`outputChannel.ts`):
   - Increased timeout for output panel to become visible after command execution (5s to 10s)
   - Better handles timing when command execution takes longer

### Test Results:
- Web: ✓ 21/21 tests pass (clear output channel test now passing consistently)
- Desktop (macOS): Tests run individually pass; some flakiness in full suite run
- Output channel clearing test verifies channel is completely cleared with screenshot verification

### Files Modified:
- packages/playwright-vscode-ext/src/pages/commands.ts
- packages/playwright-vscode-ext/src/pages/outputChannel.ts

### Status:
- All test files exist and are implemented (commandPalette, fileOperations, settings, outputChannel, contextMenu, helpers)
- Web tests passing (21/21)
- Desktop tests: 17-18 pass, 3 skipped (context menu tests + Ctrl+Shift+P test on macOS)
- Output channel clearing test includes screenshot verification as required
- Working on ensuring consistent test execution across all platforms
