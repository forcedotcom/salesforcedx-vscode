## Iteration - Fixed Test Isolation Issues for Desktop Tests

### Status:
- All test files exist and are implemented (commandPalette, fileOperations, settings, outputChannel, contextMenu, helpers)
- CI run 20974781441 results:
  - Web: ✓ success (all tests passing, 6m19s)
  - macOS desktop: ✓ success (all tests passing, 8m7s)
  - Windows desktop: ✓ success (all tests passing, 10m8s)
  - All platforms passing! Windows desktop issue resolved - VSCODE_DESKTOP environment variable now properly set in workflow

## Iteration - Cleanup and Refactoring (Step 10)

### Cleanup completed:
- Simplified `ensureOutputPanelOpen` in outputChannel.ts:
  - Removed duplicate workbench click (was called twice)
  - Simplified fallback from multiple command variations to single command ("Output: Focus on Output View")
  - Removed unnecessary `.catch()` calls where errors should propagate
  - Kept minimal fallback to command palette for desktop compatibility
- Verified output channel clearing works correctly (screenshot confirms empty channel)
- Fixed `selectOutputChannel` to reliably select channels on desktop:
  - Changed to iterate through all options and find matching channel by text or value
  - Select by value attribute instead of label for more reliable selection
  - Fixes timeout issue when selecting 'Window' channel on desktop
- All tests passing locally: web (21 passed), desktop (18 passed)
- Commit a8905a774 pushed to GitHub
- CI run 20975781892 results:
  - Web: ✓ success (all tests passing)
  - macOS desktop: ✓ success (all tests passing)
  - Windows desktop: ✓ success (all tests passing)
  - All platforms passing!

## Iteration - Plan Update and Verification (Steps 0, 1a, 14b)

### Completed:
- Removed completed todos from plan.md per step 14b (all todos complete)
- Verified output channel clearing requirement (1a):
  - Test calls `clearOutputChannel` which verifies clearing internally
  - Test takes screenshot (`output-channel-cleared.png`) to verify visually
  - Test verifies again after screenshot that text length is 0
  - Screenshot confirms output channel is completely cleared with no text left
- Verified all tests passing locally: web (21 passed), desktop (18 passed)
- Verified CI run 20975781892: all platforms passing (web, macOS desktop, Windows desktop)
