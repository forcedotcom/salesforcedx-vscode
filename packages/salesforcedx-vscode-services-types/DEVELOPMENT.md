# Development Guide

## Package Overview

This package (`@salesforce/vscode-services`) publishes TypeScript type definitions for the `salesforcedx-vscode-services` extension API. It contains only `.d.ts` files with no runtime code.

The package uses Node.js `exports` field to enforce that only the main `SalesforceVSCodeServicesApi` type is accessible. Internal types and implementation details cannot be directly imported.

## How It Works

### Generated Source

The source code is **not committed** to git. Instead, it's generated on-demand from the parent package:

1. `scripts/generateEntry.ts` creates `src/index.ts` that re-exports only `SalesforceVSCodeServicesApi`
2. TypeScript compiles this along with all referenced types from the parent package
3. The output `out/` directory contains all necessary `.d.ts` files

Scripts are written in TypeScript and executed via `ts-node` for type safety.

### Dependency Sync

Dependencies are automatically synced from the parent package:

```bash
npm run sync-deps
```

This script:

- Reads `../salesforcedx-vscode-services/package.json`
- Extracts all relevant dependencies
- Updates this package's `package.json` with matching versions
- Syncs the version number

### Build Process

```bash
npm run compile
```

This runs:

1. `precompile` â†’ `generate-entry` (creates `src/index.ts`)
2. `tsc` compiles types from both local and parent source

### Publishing

```bash
# from the top-level of the repo, not the project
npm run compile
```

Before publishing, this automatically:

1. Syncs dependencies and version from parent
2. Generates source entry point
3. Compiles all types

## Local Testing

### Method 1: Using npm pack

```bash
# Build and pack
npm run compile
npm pack

# Install in test project
cd /path/to/test-project
npm install /path/to/salesforce-vscode-services-X.X.X.tgz

# Test imports
cat > test.ts << 'EOF'
import type { SalesforceVSCodeServicesApi } from '@salesforce/vscode-services';
const api: SalesforceVSCodeServicesApi = {} as any;
EOF

npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck test.ts
```

### Method 2: Using npm link

```bash
# In types package
npm run compile
npm link

# In test project
npm link @salesforce/vscode-services

# Test and unlink when done
npm unlink @salesforce/vscode-services
```

## Keeping in Sync

### Automatic Sync

The types stay in sync automatically because:

- Source is generated from parent on each build
- Dependencies are synced from parent before publish
- Version is synced from parent before publish

### Manual Checks

To verify sync:

```bash
# Check that compilation works
npm run compile

# Check dependencies match parent
npm run sync-deps
git diff package.json  # Should show no changes if already synced

# Check package contents
npm pack --dry-run
```

## CI/CD Integration

### Automated Publishing

The package is automatically published to npm when a GitHub release is created via the `.github/workflows/publishNpmTypes.yml` workflow.

**Workflow Steps:**

1. **Version Validation**: Compares release tag (e.g., `v64.4.0`) with `package.json` version
2. **Pre-publish**: Runs `prepublishOnly` script which:
   - Syncs dependencies and version from parent package
   - Generates source entry point
   - Compiles all TypeScript declarations
3. **Publish**: Publishes package to npm with public access

**Requirements:**

- `NPM_TOKEN` secret must be configured in repository settings
- Release tag must match the version in parent `salesforcedx-vscode-services/package.json`
- Package version will be auto-synced from parent during publish

**Triggering:**

- Automatic: When a GitHub release is published (not pre-release)
- Manual: Via workflow_dispatch button in GitHub Actions UI

### Validation Script

```bash
# Validate types package is ready for publish
cd packages/salesforcedx-vscode-services-types
npm run clean
npm install
npm run sync-deps
npm run compile
npm pack
```

## Troubleshooting

### Types not resolving correctly

**Problem**: Consumer can't import types
**Solution**: Check `package.json` `types` field points to correct path

### Dependencies out of sync

**Problem**: Version mismatch errors
**Solution**: Run `npm run sync-deps` before publish

### Compilation errors

**Problem**: TypeScript can't find parent types
**Solution**: Ensure `tsconfig.json` includes parent source directory

### Package too large

**Problem**: Package includes unnecessary files
**Solution**: Check `.npmignore` only allows `out/**/*.d.ts` files and required metadata

## Common Commands

```bash
# Full build from scratch
npm run clean && npm install && npm run compile

# Sync and build
npm run sync-deps && npm run compile

# Test package contents
npm pack --dry-run

# Create tarball
npm pack

# Publish (auto-syncs first)
npm publish
```
