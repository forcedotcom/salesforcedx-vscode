The Refresh Token policy is evaluated only during usage of the issued refresh token and doesn’t affect a user’s current session.

If a user uses the app for 2 hours, the user isn’t forced to reauthenticate after 1 hour.

The user can use the current session (access token) already issued, but can’t obtain a new session when the access token expires. infinite—The refresh token is used indefinitely, unless revoked by the user or Salesforce admin.

For example, if the policy states specific_lifetime:1:DAYS, the user can obtain new sessions for only 24 hours. specific_inactivity:number:HOURS, DAYS, MONTHS—The refresh token is valid as long as it’s been used within the specified amount of time. For example, if set to specific_inactivity:7:DAYS, and the refresh token isn’t exchanged for a new session within seven days, the next attempt to use the token fails.
