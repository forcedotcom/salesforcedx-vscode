# salesforcedx-vscode-lightning
This extension uses the default HTML language server from VS Code to provide syntax highlighting, code completion, an outline view of your files, and a Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) linter.

For best results, use this extension with the other extensions in the [salesforcedx-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.salesforcedx-vscode) bundle.

This release contains a beta version of Salesforce Development Tools for Visual Studio Code, which means it’s a high-quality feature with known limitations. Salesforce Development Tools for Visual Studio Code isn’t generally available unless or until Salesforce announces its general availability in documentation or in press releases or public statements. We can’t guarantee general availability within any particular time frame or at all. Make your purchase decisions only on the basis of generally available products and features. You can provide feedback and suggestions for Salesforce Development Tools for Visual Studio Code in the [Salesforce DX Beta](https://success.salesforce.com/_ui/core/chatter/groups/GroupProfilePage?g=0F93A000000HTp1) group in the Success Community.
