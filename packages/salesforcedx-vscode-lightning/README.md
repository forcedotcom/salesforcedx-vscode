# Lightning Component Framework for Visual Studio Code

This extension uses the default HTML language server from VS Code to provide syntax highlighting, code completion, an outline view of your files, and a Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) linter.

**For best results, do not install this extension directly. Install the complete [Salesforce Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.salesforcedx-vscode) instead.**

## Prerequisites

Before you set up this extension, make sure that you have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) v1.26 or later.
