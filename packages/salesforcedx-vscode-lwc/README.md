It uses the default HTML language server from VS Code to provide syntax highlighting, code completion, an outline view of your files, and a Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) linter.

**Currently, this extension is not included in the [Salesforce Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.salesforcedx-vscode).**
