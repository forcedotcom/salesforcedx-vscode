# Introduction

This is the top-level language server for supporting .page and .component files
for Visualforce. This borrows heavily from the Microsoft VS Code overall [HTML
language
server](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/tree/master/extensions/html) -- the
one that can handle a combination of JavaScript and CSS embedded within HTML.
