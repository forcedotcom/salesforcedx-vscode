# Apex Interactive Debugger for Visual Studio Code

This extension enables VS Code to use the real-time Apex Debugger with your scratch orgs and to use ISV Customer Debugger with your subscribers’ sandbox orgs.

**DO NOT INSTALL THIS EXTENSION DIRECTLY. Install the complete [Salesforce Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.salesforcedx-vscode) instead.**
