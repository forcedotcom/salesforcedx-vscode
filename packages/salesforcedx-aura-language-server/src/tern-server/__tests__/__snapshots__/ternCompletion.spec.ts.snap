There be dragons here.

Manage the queue of actions sent to the server.

Queue Processing Notes:
 * The queue is processed synchronously, but almost all of the interesting functionality occurs asynchronously.
 * client actions are run in a single flow of setTimeout calls.
 * storable server actions get processed in the "then" clause of the promise
 * non-storable server actions are processed synchronously.

Input conditions:
We have a queue of actions that are inserted vie enqueueAction.

Dangers:
 * Race conditions.
 * caboose actions.
 * problems with storage.
 * complexity of code due to asynchronicity.

Tradeoffs:
 * number of actions boxcarred.
 * actions in flight
 * sending XHR early vs. late.

Processing Loop:
 * gather actions into a collector.
 * walk each action, queueing up server actions to retrieve from storage and client actions to execute.
 * execute client actions with setTimeout(0) to allow server actions to complete.
 * As server actions come back from storage, queue up for execution, and queue refresh actions to refresh.
 * After all actions collect, check for further actions in the queue, restart loop if there are some.
 * Once we have finished processing all actions, check for actions to be put in an XHR.
   + All foreground actions go in a single XHR, and are de-duped on send.
   + background actions are sent one per XHR, with a de-dupe step during the queue walk.
   + deferred actions are sent if we are idle, with a de-dupe step during the queue walk.

Queues:
 * actionsQueued - queue of actions that have yet to be processed.
 * actionsDeferred - actions that have been processed through storage, but need to go to the server.

with a server-provided key, persisting into the IndexedDB adapter.

Unlike other storage adapters this adapter does not automatically register itself. Use
&lt;auraStorage:crypto/&gt; in the &lt;auraPreInitBlock/&gt; section of the app's template
to register this adapter. Doing so guarantees that CryptoAdapter.setKey() will be invoked
with a server-provided cryptographic key.

Please note:
1. If the runtime environment doesn't support the Web Cryptography API the adapter is not
   registered.
2. After registration and before a cryptographic key is provided, all crypto adapters
   enter an initialization stage. Get, put, and remove operations are queued until
   the key is set. If a key is never provided then the operations appear paused. It's
   thus paramount to always provide a key. &lt;auraStorage:crypto/&gt; ensures this
   happens.
3. If an invalid cryptographic key is provided, the adapter automatically falls
   back to the memory adapter to provide secure but non-persistent storage.

Implementation notes:

Each store name gets its own DB. Each app gets its own ObjectStore (aka table). If the same
store name is used across apps (eg actions ) then a single DB contains multiple ObjectStores.
TODO - it'd be better scoped to have one DB per app with all its tables within.

Sizing is approximate and updates to sizes are very approximate. We recalculate when our error bars get
too big or after a certain number of updates. This is locked to happen no more than once every 15 minutes
if our size is not over the limit.
TODO - revamp size calculations to be more understandable while still supporting multiple browser tabs

Entire table scans are performed for:
(1) getAll, since we have to.
(2) size or error bar over the limit.
(3) getSize, with an old size guess.
(4) sweep, since we're already scanning the table.
