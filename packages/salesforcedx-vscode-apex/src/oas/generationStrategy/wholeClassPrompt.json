  "USER_PROMPT": "Generate an OpenAPI v3 specification for the following Apex class. The OpenAPI v3 specification should be a YAML file. The paths should be in the format of /{ClassName}/{MethodName} for all the @AuraEnabled methods specified. For every `type: object`, generate a `#/components/schemas` entry for that object. The method should have a $ref entry pointing to the generated `#/components/schemas` entry. Only include methods that have the @AuraEnabled annotation in the paths of the OpenAPI v3 specification. I do not want AUTHOR_PLACEHOLDER in the result."
