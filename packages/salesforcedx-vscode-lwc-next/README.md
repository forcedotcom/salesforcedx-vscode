# salesforcedx-vscode-lwc-next

This is a preview of a work in progress implementation of the salesforcedx-vscode-lwc-next extension. It is published to enable early feedback and testing. 

Install either this version (if you have been granted early access) or the salesforcedx-vscode-lwc-next version. Do not install both.

salesforce-vscode-lwc is part of a private pilot for testing new features. We are not accepting pilot enrollments at this time. This extension will not work unless you are part of the pilot.

We provide salesforce-vscode-lwc to selected customers through a pilot program that requires agreement to specific terms and conditions. salesforce-vscode-lwc is subject to change and isn’t generally available unless or until Salesforce announces its general availability in documentation or in press releases or public statements. We can’t guarantee general availability within any particular time frame or at all. Make your purchase decisions only on the basis of generally available products and features.
