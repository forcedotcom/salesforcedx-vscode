# Visualforce for Visual Studio Code

This extension uses the Visualforce Language Server and Visual Studio Code’s default HTML language server to provide syntax highlighting, code completion, and an outline view of your files.

**DO NOT INSTALL THIS EXTENSION DIRECTLY. Install the complete [Salesforce Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.salesforcedx-vscode) instead.**
