# 64.0.3 - June 15, 2025

## Fixed

#### salesforcedx-vscode-apex

- We fixed an issue so that the "Rename Symbol (F2)" function in Visual Studio Code now correctly renames symbols in an Apex file. Thank you [Pawel Wozniak](https://github.com/PawelWozniak) for creating the issue.

#### salesforcedx-vscode-core
