# 64.9.1 - August 13, 2025

## Added

#### salesforcedx-vscode
#### salesforcedx-vscode-expanded

- We have increased our minimum supported VSCode version to (latest - 2). If you are currently using an older version of VSCode, you will need to update to maintain compatibility and continue receiving extension updates. ([PR #6452](https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode/pull/6452))

## Fixed

#### salesforcedx-vscode-core

- We fixed a bug where trace flags created by Developer Console were appearing in VSCode. Now trace flags created from Developer Console and VSCode are isolated from each other. ([PR #6465](https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode/pull/6465))
