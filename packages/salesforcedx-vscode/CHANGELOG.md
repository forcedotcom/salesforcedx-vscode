# 65.13.1 - January 16, 2026

## Added

#### salesforcedx-vscode-apex
#### salesforcedx-vscode-apex-replay-debugger
#### salesforcedx-vscode-apex-testing

- We enhanced Apex test reporting with configurable output formats and sorting. You can now generate test reports in Markdown or plain text, customize sorting by runtime, coverage, or severity, and highlight slow or low-coverage tests using configurable performance and coverage thresholds. Reports are saved with timestamped filenames and automatically opened for easy review. ([PR #6750](https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode/pull/6750))
