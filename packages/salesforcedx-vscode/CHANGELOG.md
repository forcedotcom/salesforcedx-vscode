# 64.9.1 - August 13, 2025

## Added

#### salesforcedx-vscode
#### salesforcedx-vscode-expanded

- We’ve raised our minimum supported VS Code version to the latest minus two releases. If you’re on an older version, update VS Code to stay compatible and keep installing extension updates. ([PR #6452](https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode/pull/6452))

## Fixed

#### salesforcedx-vscode-core

- We fixed a bug where trace flags from Developer Console were showing up in VS Code. Now, trace flags created in each stay separate. ([PR #6465](https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode/pull/6465))
