# Salesforce Extensions for Visual Studio Code

This extension pack includes tools for developing on the Salesforce platform in the lightweight, extensible VS Code editor. These tools provide features for working with development orgs (scratch orgs, sandboxes, and DE orgs), Apex, Aura components, and Visualforce.

## Prerequisites

Before you set up Salesforce Extensions for VS Code, make sure that you have these essentials.

- **Salesforce CLI**  
  Before you use Salesforce Extensions for VS Code, [set up the Salesforce CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup).
- **A Salesforce DX project**
  Open your Salesforce DX project in a directory that contains an `sfdx-project.json` file. Otherwise, some features don’t work.  
  If you don't already have a Salesforce DX project, create one with the **SFDX: Create Project** command (for development against scratch orgs) or the **SFDX: Create Project with Manifest** command (for development against sandboxes or DE orgs). Or, see [create a Salesforce DX project](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_workspace_setup.htm) for information about setting up a project using Salesforce CLI.
- **Java 8 Platform, Standard Edition Development Kit**  
  Some features in Salesforce Extensions for VS Code depend upon the Java 8 Platform, Standard Edition Development Kit (JDK).  
  If you don’t already have the JDK installed, install the latest version of the Java 8 JDK from [Java SE Development Kit 8 Downloads](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).
- **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) v1.26 or later**
