## Playwright VSCode Extension E2E Tests - Progress (2026-01-11)

### Test Infrastructure Created
- Created test directory structure: fixtures/, specs/, web/
- Created fixtures/index.ts and fixtures/desktopFixtures.ts
- Created web/headlessServer.ts
- Created playwright.config.web.ts and playwright.config.desktop.ts
- Updated tsconfig.json to include test/**/*.ts
- Updated package.json with test:web and test:desktop scripts

### Test Specs Status
- helpers.headless.spec.ts - PASSING (3/3 tests web)
- commandPalette.headless.spec.ts - PASSING (3/3 tests web)
- settings.headless.spec.ts - PASSING (4/4 tests web)
- fileOperations.headless.spec.ts - FAILING (0/4 tests - needs web-compatible implementation)
- outputChannel.headless.spec.ts - FAILING (1/5 tests, ensureOutputPanelOpen works)
- contextMenu.headless.spec.ts - FAILING (0/2 tests - needs web-compatible implementation)

### Recent Changes (Latest Session - 2026-01-11)
1. File Operations: Attempted multiple approaches to fix file creation
   - Tried "Create: New File..." - dialog doesn't work reliably in VS Code web
   - Tried "File: New Untitled Text File" + "File: Save As..." - Save As doesn't open VS Code dialog in web
   - Tried "File: New Untitled Text File" + Ctrl+S - Same issue with save dialog
   - Root cause: VS Code web file save dialogs trigger native browser dialogs that Playwright can't interact with
   - NEEDS FIX: Must find web-compatible approach (per ralph.sh: "Web tests should never be skipped")

### Web Test Results (Current)
- 7/15 tests passing (helpers 3/3, commandPalette 3/3, settings 4/4)
- 0/15 tests skipped (per ralph.sh requirement)
- 8/15 tests failing (fileOperations 4/4, outputChannel 4/5, contextMenu 2/2)

### Failures Remaining
1. Output channel - selectOutputChannel can't find combobox dropdown (4/5 tests)
   - ensureOutputPanelOpen works, but selectOutputChannel times out at outputChannel.ts:55
   - Timeout waiting for getByRole('combobox').filter({ has: getByRole('option', { name: ... }) })
   - Root cause: combobox selector may be incorrect for test environment
   - Need to investigate actual DOM structure of output channel selector

### Next Actions (Per ralph.sh Sequence)
1. Fix output channel dropdown selector (investigate DOM structure)
2. Verify org-browser tests still pass (web and desktop)
3. Run desktop tests locally on macOS (file operations should work there)
4. Commit and push changes
5. Monitor e2e run on GitHub Actions
6. Return to file operations tests later with alternative approaches
