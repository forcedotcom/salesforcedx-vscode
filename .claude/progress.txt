## Playwright VSCode Extension E2E Tests - Progress (2026-01-11)

### Test Infrastructure Created
- Created test directory structure: fixtures/, specs/, web/
- Created fixtures/index.ts and fixtures/desktopFixtures.ts
- Created web/headlessServer.ts
- Created playwright.config.web.ts and playwright.config.desktop.ts
- Updated tsconfig.json to include test/**/*.ts
- Updated package.json with test:web and test:desktop scripts

### Test Specs Created
- helpers.headless.spec.ts - PASSING (3/3 tests)
- commandPalette.headless.spec.ts - PASSING (3/3 tests)
- fileOperations.headless.spec.ts - FAILING (0/4 tests)
- settings.headless.spec.ts - FAILING (1/4 tests, openSettingsUI works)
- outputChannel.headless.spec.ts - FAILING (1/5 tests, ensureOutputPanelOpen works)
- contextMenu.headless.spec.ts - FAILING (0/2 tests)

### Web Test Results (First Run)
- 8/21 tests passing
- 13/21 tests failing

### Failures to Fix
1. File operations - createFileWithContents timing out (needs workspace)
2. Settings - "Preferences: Open Workspace Settings" command lookup failing (needs investigation)
3. Output channel - selectOutputChannel timing out (needs investigation)
4. Context menu - tests timing out (needs workspace with files)

### Next Action
Per ralph.sh instructions, focus on ONE test at a time. Start with settings since openSettingsUI already works.
Need to debug why upsertSettings is failing on command palette lookup.
