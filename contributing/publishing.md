# Publishing

This is a guide for publishing to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. Most contributors will not need to worry about publishing. However, it might be worthwhile familiarizing yourself with the steps in case you need to share the
extensions through the .vsix files.

# Goal

The goal of publishing is to take the extensions under `/packages`, bundle them as
.vsix files, and push them to the [Visual Studio Code
Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode).

For more information about publishing take a look at:

- [Publishing VS Code Extensions][publish_vscode_ext]
- [Managing Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery)

# Prerequisites

1. Publisher is a part of the GitHub team 'PDT'.

# Steps

## Creating a Release Branch

The release branch is typically created from a scheduled job in Github Actions. This scheduled job creates the release branch off of the `develop` branch on Mondays at 3 PM GMT (i.e. 7AM or 8AM Pacific time depending on daylight savings). Release branches are in the format `release/vxx.yy.zz`.
Creating a release branch automatically generates the change log based off of the new commits that are being staged for production. The change log generator helps us automate the process of generating the `CHANGELOG.md` with the correct format and commits being staged.

## Verifying the Change Log

One of the members of [Doc Maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/forcedotcom/teams/doc-maintainers/members) would review the changelog and make any changes to the release branch. A pull request will be opened against the release branch with updates to be included.

## Merging the Release Branch into Main

After the change log has been approved and merged into your release branch, it's time to prepare main with the new changes for the publish. A Github Action workflow is executed to merge the release branch. We are specifically using the rebase strategy because we want all the commits from our release branch to be applied on top of the commits in main.

### To run the merge process:

1. From the github repository navigate to the Action Tab and Select the PreRelease workflow on the left
1. Click the 'Run Workflow' button and input the branch to be merged into the input box.
1. Click the `Run Workflow` button.

The PreRelease job will verify if the version of the branch to be merged is newer than what is currently in main and update main with the release branch.

## Publishing Main

The merge into main will trigger a run of the 'Test, Build, and Release' GHA workflow that will:
- run the tests
- build vsix files
- send a slack notification that a release workflow has been initiated
- create a tag and release in Github

After the release has been created, it will trigger a publish action that will send a notification to slack to request approval to publish the vsix files to the marketplace.

Before approving the release to the marketplace, download the vsix files, install them locally and verify they are working as expected.

After you feel comfortable publishing to the marketplace, approve the publish job in the Github Action UI.

## Post-Publishing the .vsix

1. Update the Salesforce Extension Pack to the version you just published. Either go to Extensions, select Salesforce Extension pack, and update... or go to https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.salesforcedx-vscode, download the version you published, and install.
2. Restart Visual Studio Code
3. Test & validate the application.
4. Once validated, post an announcement in #platform-dev-tools

# Publishing a Beta Pre-Release

If there is a release with high-risk or large-scale changes, we can publish a pre-release to allow advanced users to test early. VSIX artifacts are uploaded to a github release as with our usual release but there is no publish to NPM or the VS Code Marketplace (yet).

## Steps

1. Create a release branch, and increment the version using Lerna, as shown in the `create-release-branch.js` file, starting at the creation of the release branch.
2. For the version number, keep the minor version the same and set the patch to use the following format: year month day hour minute. For example, v55.11.202208260522.
3. Push the branch to remote.
4. From the Actions tab in Github select the workflow 'Publish Beta Release to Github Only'.
5. Select 'Run Workflow', and run the workflow from the beta branch. The workflow can only be run someone with write privileges of this repo.
6. The workflow will create the git tag, the release, and attach the individual VSIX files to the release where they can be downloaded and tested.

Note that the beta branch, because of the unique versioning, should not be merged back to develop. When the code is ready for a standard release, the regular release branching process should be followed.

# Manual Publish

The steps used to publish to the VS Code Marketplace can be found in the associated Github Actions.

## Generating a Major Release

The versioning we follow is intentionally mapped with Salesforce Core. When a major version bump occurs, such as 53.0 -> 54.0, we release a major version update as well.

## Downloading the .vsix from Github Action

### Options

- Download directly from the Github Action run. You will find artifacts that are associated with a run at the bottom of the summary screen
- Use the gh cli to download artifacts. `gh run download --dir /dir/where/you/want/the/vsix/files/ 3746978326`. The last arg is the GHA job id. This can be found in the UI or by executing `gh run list`.

**At this stage, it is possible to share the .vsix directly for manual
installation.**

To manually install vsix files you can use the `code` or `code-insiders` cli.

- `code-insiders --install-extension /path/to/the/vsix/iama.vsix`
- or install all downloaded vsix files `find ./vsix/download/path -type f -name "*.vsix" -exec code --install-extension {} \;`

## Generating SHA256

Due to [vscode-vsce#191](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-vsce/issues/191)
the .vsix are neither signed nor verified. To ensure that they have not been
tampered with, we generate a SHA256 of the contents and publish that to
https://developer.salesforce.com/media/vscode/SHA256

### Steps

1. `npm run vscode:sha256` will compute the SHA256 for the .vsix generated in
   the previous stage.
1. The SHA256 are appended to the top-level SHA256 file.
1. Finally the file is added to git so that it can be committed.

## Pushing .vsix to Visual Studio Marketplace

### Prerequisite

- You have a personal access token that for the salesforce publisher id that is
  exported as `VSCE_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`. Go to [Publishing VS Code Extensions][publish_vscode_ext] for steps on getting your personal access token.
- Or, you have vsce installed and configured with the salesforce publisher id.
- Verify you have access to publish:

```
$ vsce login (publisher name)
```

### Steps

1. `npm run vscode:publish` takes the .vsix that you had _before_ and uploads
   it to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.

It's **crucial** that you publish the .vsix that you had before so that the
SHA256 match. If you were to repackage, the SHA256 would be different.

## Merging Back From the Release Branch Into Develop and Main

### Prerequisite

- Artifacts have been published.

### Steps

See this
[guide](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow)
from Atlassian on the flow. These steps are manual because you might encounter merge conflicts.

1. `git checkout main`
1. `git pull` to get the latest changes (there shouldn't be any since you are
   the person releasing).
1. `git merge release/vxx.y.z`
1. `git push`
1. `git checkout develop`
1. `git pull` to get the latest changes.
1. `git merge release/vxx.y.z`
1. `git push`

# Tips

1. In order to make a previously unpublished extension publishable there are a
   few things that need to get updated:
   1. In packages/salesforcedx-vscode/package.json the extension needs to get added
      to the list of `extensionDependencies`
   2. In the extension's package.json ensure that `bugs` and `repository` both have
      their `url` attributes set.
      For `bugs` the url is `https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode/issues`
      For `repository` the url is `https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode`
   3. In the extension's package.json, under `scripts` the following attributes need
      to be defined:
      `"vscode:prepublish": "npm prune --production"`
      `"vscode:package": "vsce package"`
      `"vscode:sha256": "node ../../scripts/generate-sha256.js >> ../../SHA256"`
      `"vscode:publish": "node ../../scripts/publish-vsix.js"`
