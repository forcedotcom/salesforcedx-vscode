# Publishing

This is a guide for publishing to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. Most
contributors will not need to worry about publishing. However, it might be
worthwhile familiarizing yourself with the steps in case you need to share the
extensions through the .vsix files.

# Goal

The goal of publishing is to take the extensions under /packages, bundle them as
.vsix files, and push them to the [Visual Studio Code
Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode).

For more information about publishing take a look at

- [Publishing VS Code Extensions][publish_vscode_ext]
- [Managing
  Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery)

# Steps

The scripts/publish.js contains the end-to-end flow. You run this from the
**top-level** directory.

The files under scripts use [shelljs/shx](https://github.com/shelljs/shx) and
[shelljs/shelljs](https://github.com/shelljs/shelljs) to write scripts in a
portable manner across platforms.

1. `git checkout -t origin release/vxx.yy.zz`
1. `npm install`
1. `export SALESFORCEDX_VSCODE_VERSION=xx.yy.zz` (must match the branch version)
1. `scripts/publish.js`

It is possible to run each step manually as illustrated below.

## Packaging as .vsix

### Prerequisite

- Lerna is properly installed (`npm install -g lerna@3.13.1`).
- All tests have been run prior to publishing. We don't run the tests during the
  publishing cycle since it generates artifacts that we do not want to include
  in the packaged extensions.

### Steps

1. `npm install` to install all the dependencies and to symlink interdependent
   local modules.
1. `npm run compile` to compile all the TypeScript files.
1. `lerna publish ...` (see scripts/publish.js for the full command) will
   increment the version in the individual package.json to prepare for
   publication. **This also commits the changes to git and adds a tag.**
1. `npm run vscode:package` packages _each_ extension as a .vsix.

**At this stage, it is possible to share the .vsix directly for manual
installation.**

## Generating SHA256

Due to [vscode-vsce#191](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-vsce/issues/191)
the .vsix are neither signed nor verified. To ensure that they have not been
tampered with, we generate a SHA256 of the contents and publish that to
https://developer.salesforce.com/media/vscode/SHA256

### Prerequisite

- You have access to our S3 bucket at s3://dfc-data-production/media/vscode
- You have the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed and configured
  via `aws configure` or have the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
  `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` exported as environment variables.
- Verify you have access to our S3 bucket:

```
$ aws s3 ls s3://dfc-data-production/media/vscode/
```

### Steps

1. `npm run vscode:sha256` will compute the SHA256 for the .vsix generated in
   the previous stage.
1. The SHA256 are appended to the top-level SHA256 file.
1. This file is then copied over to our S3 bucket.
1. Finally the file is added to git so that it can be committed.

## Pushing .vsix to Visual Studio Marketplace

### Prerequisite

- You have a personal access token that for the salesforce publisher id that is
  exported as `VSCE_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`. Go to [Publishing VS Code Extensions][publish_vscode_ext] for steps on getting your personal access token.
- Or, you have vsce installed and configured with the salesforce publisher id.
- Verify you have access to publish:

```
$ vsce login (publisher name)
```

### Steps

1. `npm run vscode:publish` takes the .vsix that you had _before_ and uploads
   it to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.

It's **crucial** that you publish the .vsix that you had before so that the
SHA256 match. If you were to repackage, the SHA256 would be different.

## Merging back from the release branch into develop and master

### Prerequisite

- Artifacts have been published.

### Steps

See this
[guide](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow)
from Atlassian on the flow. These steps are manual because you might encounter merge conflicts.

1. `git checkout master`
1. `git pull` to get the latest changes (there shouldn't be any since you are
   the person releasing).
1. `git merge release/vxx.y.z`
1. `git push`
1. `git checkout develop`
1. `git pull` to get the latest changes.
1. `git merge release/vxx.y.z`
1. `git push`

# Tips

1. After publishing, you will need to run `npm run bootstrap` again to continue
   development. This is because the `npm run vscode:package` step does a `npm prune --production`. This is required due to the way Lerna does symlinking.
   See [vscode-vsce#52](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-vsce/issues/52) for
   more information.

1. In order to make a previously unpublished extension publishable there are a
   few things that need to get updated:
   1. In packages/salesforcedx-vscode/package.json the extension needs to get added
      to the list of `extensionDependencies`
   2. In the extension's package.json ensure that `bugs` and `repository` both have
      their `url` attributes set.
      For `bugs` the url is `https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode/issues`
      For `repository` the url is `https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode`
   3. In the extension's package.json, under `scripts` the following attributes need
      to be defined:
      `"vscode:prepublish": "npm prune --production"`
      `"vscode:package": "vsce package"`
      `"vscode:sha256": "node ../../scripts/generate-sha256.js >> ../../SHA256"`
      `"vscode:publish": "node ../../scripts/publish-vsix.js"`
