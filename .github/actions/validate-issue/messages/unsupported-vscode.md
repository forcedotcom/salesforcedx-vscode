Hello @THE_AUTHOR :wave:

Shared: `USER_VERSION`
Minimum Supported: `MIN_VERSION`

It looks like you're using an outdated version of VSCode. USER_VERSION is no longer supported by the Salesforce Extensions for VSCode as of February 29, 2024. We highly recommend you move from USER_VERSION to the latest VSCode version ASAP.

Download the latest VSCode [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

After you install a supported VSCode version, run your command again and see if the VSCode upgrade resolves your issue. If the issue still persists, please provide your VSCode version and we can continue diagnosing.
