Hello @THE_AUTHOR :wave: Your version of nodeJS (`NODE_VERSION`) is not supported.

We recommend using LTS and we support anything Node says is `Current`, `Active` and `Maintenance`.

See Node's [version status](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases).

This issue will be closed. If you're able to reproduce your issue on a supported node version, please open a new issue.
