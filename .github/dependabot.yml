# To get started with Dependabot version updates, you'll need to specify which
# package ecosystems to update and where the package manifests are located.
# Please see the documentation for all configuration options:
# https://help.github.com/github/administering-a-repository/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates

# Notes:
# - Use "redhat.vscode-yaml" extension for schema and config validation
# - Must have a unique combination of 'package-ecosystem', 'directory', and 'target-branch'.
