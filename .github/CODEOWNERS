# CODEOWNERS adds reviewers depending on the location of the change.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @js-owner and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @forcedotcom/pdt will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
*       @forcedotcom/pdt

# If the change occurs within the docs directory, add the doc maintainers.
